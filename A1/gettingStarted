We want to be able to open the movie one frame at a time and analyze each image accordingly: Convert image to gray scale and threshold the image to binary black and white, then use that to make our bounding box.

Open CV thresholding:
threshold() needs a gray scale image.
args:
	src: source image
	thresh: color to determine thresh bounds (start at 127?)
	maxval: probably 255
	type: we want THRESH_BINARY
