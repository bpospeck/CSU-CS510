The 1st 4 assignments for Image Computation were done in C++ on Linux department machines at CSU.
The last 2 were done using Python on an Anaconda distribution on my own Windows laptop.
All assignments used OpenCV.

The assignments were all paired projects, and for A4 and A2 I had a tough time getting a solid working piece of code in time.
My partner had better luck with his code so we used his for the code presentations of those assignments.

The tensor flow folder was the final assignment and has a lot more scattered pieces of information in it.

The rest of the folders essentially contain examples and helpful pieces of code that were used to demonstrate
some of the parts of OpenCV before we had to use them ourselves
